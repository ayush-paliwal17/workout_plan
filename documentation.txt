A personal Trainer which will generate a personalized daily workout.

Stages.
Stage 1 - a. The gym member can interact with the application, enter their member_id and have a pre-defined workout generated for them. 
          b. We are targeting two-body parts approach. The application should automatically change the body-parts after a workout and should generate different workout for the same body-parts (minimum 3 combinations)

Stage 2 - a. Create a GUI, 
          b. which takes member_id as input, 
          c. a generate workout button, 
          d. have the workout printed on the screen with a different image, 
          e. remove all other widgets.

Stage 3 - We must be able to print the workout on a paper. 

Stage 4 - Add methods for customers such as see profile, choose body-parts to train, maybe change approach (circuit,2 parts,1 part etc), select their own workout, see workout history(upto 10 days)

Stage 5 - This is where the gym owner comes in,
# for iron fitness gym
#1. have two buttons, one for customers to generate their workout and one for the trainers to generate workout based on their choice
#2. for trainers have option to select body parts, based on that have a dropdown with exercises based on body part and cardio
#3. have a method to add member data and print member data along with the workout
#4. add button for members to check thier profile, workout history of the last 10 days(it implements a queue)
